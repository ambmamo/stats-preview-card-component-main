## My process

I Started with HTML structure and the proceeded to the CSS whereby I styled it based on the 1440px screen size first. Then I styled it for the 375px optimal screen size.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS properties

### What I learned

I learnt how to utilise the positioning attribute well so that i could position my divs side by side

```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child">child 1</div>
  <div class="child">child 2</div>
</div>
```

```css
.parent {
  border: 1px solid black;
  text-align: center;
}
.child {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to hone my skills box model properties in the css so positioning and arrangment are areas I want to focus on more.

### Useful resources
